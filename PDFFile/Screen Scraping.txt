It was November. Although it was not yet late, 
the sky was dark when I turned into Laun-
dress Passage. I closed the door and put the 
shop key in its usual place behind Bailey's 
Advanced Principles of Geometry. Poor 
Bailey. No one has wanted his fat gray book 
for thirty years. Sometimes I wonder what he 
makes of his role as guardian of the bookshop 
keys. I don't suppose it's the destiny he had in 
mind for the masterwork that he spent two 
decades writing.
